Filesystem structure visualization for SailfishOS

**No matter how much storage you’ve got — it will be full.**

Space Inspector helps to find large folders and files on your storage by visualizing storage usage in a diagram of boxes (aka treemap). 

In box view, each folder and file is displayed as a rectangle of the respective size, letting you dive down the structure of large directories instantly to find out which files are using up your valuable storage.
Alternatively, you can use list view to have files/directories and their size displayed in a normal list. When minized, the cover shows how much of your storage is currently used.

Please note: this app is currently in beta state. If you are having questions, problems or suggestions, please file a new issue on the project's GitHub page: https://github.com/jklingen/space-inspector/issues - thanks :)
